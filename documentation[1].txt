How the app was designed:
We scanned past questions and converted them to pdfs. We then developed an application to open the pdfs from a folder when button was clicked from the application. Initially we thought of using a database but we had problems embedding and calling from the database into the application. As such, we designed an interface for populating the database which we did not remove.

How to use the app:
We would like to get you informed about how to use this appication.

It's so simple!


1.Cut the folder inside the xip folder called "PASTQUO" and save it in your local disk (c: drive) or root directory so that in your local disk you have a folder called pastquo containing all the pdf past questions avialable to you. 

2.You can place the Pro.exe file any where on your computer favourable to you like the desktop. When using the app;

3.Always enter the course code with the letters immediately followed by the numbers eg.'cscd202','anim202','chem252'.

4.Select 'exams' in the exam type option except for CSCD202 you can enter 'IA'

5.Select only '2012' or '2015' in the exam year option.

6.Altering the names of the pdfs in the pastquo folder can result in the application not working.
